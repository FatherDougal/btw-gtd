## TODO for GTD/BTW project

#### Add Redis-backed Event Store adapter

The simplest way to do first production deployment with one server and multiple clients (console) is to have remotely accessible event store. Redis seems to be the best choice (using StackOverflow's libraries)

#### Import date/time parsing rules from OmniFocus

We want to have proper support for terms like: now, 2w, tomorrow, today, 3 days etc

#### Add perspectives to the domain model

Perspective is just a collection of filters applied to the CD action. We can keep these settings inside an aggregate, making them available to all clients


#### Add Contexts

Subj, as taken from OmniFocus

#### Add Notes to actions/projects

#### Add Folders for the projects


#### Switch all date times to DateTimeOffset
