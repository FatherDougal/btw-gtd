# "Being The Worst" Related Files (\btw directory)#

The \btw directory contains files that are specific to the Being The Worst show itself and are NOT directly related to the Domain of the software that is being discussed and implemented.  There are episode-specific sub-directories to hold files that are referenced and related to a specific podcast episode but are not directly related to the code.

For example, in Expedition 2, the "Getting Things Done"(R) domain is the primary focus of the implementation so files related to its ubiquitous language and the final docs/code that is used will be found outside of the \btw directory.  However, if an episode covers what we intend to learn while implementing this domain (i.e. a reference is made to a "study map/plan" or "Expedition Itinerary"), or we review a generic homework exercise, a listener's general code, a general dev principle, etc. then those files will be found in either the root of \btw or in episode-specific sub-directories (i.e. \btw\E019 etc.).

In short, anything outside of the \btw directory should be related to the actual implementations of the Domain, sub-domains, etc. and not general learning materials/diagrams, general reference materials, etc.
